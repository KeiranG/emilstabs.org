[Intro]

for the F#m Chord Hammer on and then pick the 4th fret D and then A strings.

F#m                            E
This beautiful world turned for eons
F#m                            E
Before we emerged from the formless void
F#m                            E
Tumbling blind in a hall of mirrors
F#m                            E
We rise in the fire, begging for water
F#m                            E
There's someone in my head, somebody's in there
F#m                            E
There's someone in my head, somebody's in there
F#m                            E
We live so many lies, then ripping metal exploded
F#m                            E
And the shaking roof expanded and flew away
F#m                            E
Dislocated fragments, turning in space
F#m                            E
Release me from the fire
F#m                            E
Take me away from this place
F#m                            E
Parallel reason under the timeless moon
F#m                            E
Float away, float away
F#m                            E
A new dawn is coming soon
F#m                            E
There's someone in my head, somebody's in there

[Chorus]
E  
It could be over
B                                  F#m
There's a new dawn, that's not far away
F#m
A new dawn is coming soon

E  
It could be over
B                                  F#m
There's a new dawn, that's not far away
F#m
A new dawn is coming soon

E  
It could be over
B                                  F#m
There's a new dawn, that's not far away
F#m
A new dawn is coming soon

E  
It could be over
B                                    C#
There's a new dawn, if you want it today


[Verse]
F#m                             
This beautiful world turned for eons
F#m                                    E
Before we emerged from the formless void
F#m  
Ripping metal exploded
F#m                  E
Ripping metal exploded
F#m  
Ripping metal exploded
F#m                      E     
And the shaking roof expanded and flew away
