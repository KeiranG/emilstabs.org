VERSE 
[D#  Gb -> Ab]
We are temporal silver men, in sulfur vessels 

[D#  Gb -> Ab]
A percussion rinse

[D#  Gb -> Ab]                                Ab      Gb
We are disc cultivators at this fatalistic gala 

[D#  Gb -> Ab]
A life saving gun

Ab               Gb
A life saving gun 

[D#  Gb -> Ab]
A life saving gun

D#                     C#                Ab                 Gb               (back to):  [D#  Gb -> Ab]
In this pepper bush of colonial ice, the cashierâ€™s fan is a life saving gun

[D#  Gb -> Ab]
In clustered columns, a vaulting cartridge, in the wall of star house, there is a life saving gun, there is a life saving gun, there is a life saving gun

D#                          C#                Ab                Gb
Shore of the mountain (?) / Life saving gun / Miso laceration / Life saving gun
